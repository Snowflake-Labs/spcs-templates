If you donâ€™t plan to explore other tutorials, you should remove billable resources you created. For more information, see Step 5 in [Tutorial 3](https://docs.snowflake.com/developer-guide/snowpark-container-services/tutorials/advanced/tutorial-3).

In addition, for this tutorial you also created an additional Snowflake internal stage (configs). Make sure you drop it (DROP STAGE configs;).

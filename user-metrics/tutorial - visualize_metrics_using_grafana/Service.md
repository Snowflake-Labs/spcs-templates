# 2: Create a service

The make command in the preceding section also creates a service specification file (metrics-service.yml) in the user-metrics directory. When you execute a CREATE SERVICE statement to create the service, you include the contents of this file inline in that statement.

1. To create the service, execute the following CREATE SERVICE command using SnowSQL CLI or Snowsight web interface.

```commandline
CREATE SERVICE metrics_visualizer
  IN COMPUTE POOL tutorial_compute_pool
  FROM SPECIFICATION $$
    <copy/paste the specification from metrics-service.yml file>
  $$;
```

2. Call the SYSTEM$GET_SERVICE_STATUS function to verify that all of the service containers are running.

```commandline
call SYSTEM$GET_SERVICE_STATUS('metrics_visualizer');
```
